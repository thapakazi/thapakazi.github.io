** intro, tl;dr
   Rubies and how to dealwith them stuffs

   There used to be time when developers were happy developing a
   monolith app, somehow get ruby and dependencies managed after
   opening, skimming via answers on stackoverflow (mostly), github
   issues/READMEs, google groups discussion threads and some blogs.

   Then things started to change, they started breaking their application
   apart and make them super complex, so many components, so many apps
   to deal now... worst part, they are developed(broken from monolith) gradually over
   time and they happen to be carrying many version of ruby, by many I
   mean more than 3 or 5... and that is what called mother of
   headache. But good news ü§ì, they developed managers [rvm, rbenv,
   chruby] to isolate/manage rubies independently as needed with less
   hassle. off-course there are downsides... ([[http://s2.quickmeme.com/img/3f/3f936bfecd98afe6b3e8bbb3e1fdffb06c4fc293a238960f63155900f3ecfeee.jpg][whisper]]: RVM makes bash
   load slow).. but not a big deal, is it üòè

   
** BTDT 
   that expands to: Been there done that

   Write some useful stuffs, don't beat around bush,
   Ok, Enough talk, lets talk business
   
   by managing rubies we do these two things:
   - get ruby on our machine
   - change version of desired ruby/gems 

   In this world of choices/options/toppings we always suffer cycle of
   choosing best option fit. which is better, *rvm*, *chruby +
   ruby-install*, *rbenv*, other options i don't know yet... I am more
   ok with *chruby + ruby-install* its all bash, ease and quick I
   suppose.
