<h1 id="story">Story</h1>

<p>This is my little story of me and typhoid. Don&rsquo;t worry, I am kinda fine now ‡§∏‡§æ‡§ö‡•ç‡§ö‡•à :). Will resume work from feb.</p>

<p>Post is kinda incomplete&#x2026;but its ok, will #addmorelater</p>

<p><strong>if you find typo, comments are welcome</strong></p>

<p>tldr;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It was dizzy, it was head-full, it was full of sweats and weakness. Like we accumulate our body and mind, I was doing opposite.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>if you are detail oriented;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It all started from dec 2018, one morning I woke up with sharp pain in my head, I tried walk to restroom for pee, and instantly felt sever ache on my stomach, hands and legs. <em>Must be futsal I</em> ü§î. Somehow I got managed to get back, everything were damn spinning, took hot water, stayed on bed for one and half hour, felt little good and started for office. Thinking it as similar thingi I had few weeks earlier, I went to office, started with my laptop, but things got worse with time, couldn&rsquo;t do my work, headache was back so was fever. So I returned home and just went straight to bed. I couldn&rsquo;t sleep, I started feel pain all over my head. Asked my brother to massage it off. Took some food and a cetamol pill, but end up with a bad vomit straight in restroom(my pant also got little taste of it :(). After vomit, it got little comfortable, took some water and went to bed again. Then fever kicks in so bad. I woke up all sweats. I was feeling so weak, helpless. ‚è≠ Later my brother took me for medication, did entire body test and discovered many interesting things about self.(will explain later). One of them was <strong>typhoid</strong>. It was 2nd time I had it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h1 id="observation">Observation</h1>

<p>I was so much careless of my health again. It was not December(cold) that got me flu/typhoid. It was my immune system that was so weak to defend anything small. It was my eating habits, sleep cycles, mental stress and bit of a physical works. I was taking my <code>body as if its like take it for granted.</code> And end of it all, suffering was for sure.</p>

<p><strong>&#x2026;</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>me: I missed this, I missed that, and I am ill.</p>

<p>bhai: you are ill, and those events occur at same time. not the other way around. Recover first.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>about food: &#x2026; about work: &#x2026;</p>

<p><strong>&#x2026;</strong></p>

<p>vocabs:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Typhoid:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>mySister</strong>: that means you ate some food/water containing bacteria from üí© and body couldn&rsquo;t fight it back.
<br /></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>Typhoid fever is a type of enteric fever&#x2026; The cause is the bacterium Salmonella Typhi&#x2026;, growing in the intestines and blood. Typhoid is spread by eating or drinking food or water contaminated with the feces of an infected person. &#x2013;Wikipedia</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li><strong>test</strong>: via blood, its called <code>widal test</code>, there is this confusing ratio that indicates you have it, lab peeps explain better.</li>
<li><strong>medication</strong>: is a antibiotic(5 days dose), that eats the cell wall of those bacteria</li>
<li><strong>recovery</strong>: it usually takes <strong>7-14</strong> days they say, but it took little longer in my case, I had to take those pills twice to kill those typhi.</li>
<li><strong>observation</strong>: during medication it like a long hangover: feeling tired all the time, lost appetite, sleepiness, minor fever.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
