<h1 id="why-i-need-this-job-so-bad">Why I need this job so bad ?</h1>

<blockquote>
<p>Frankly speaking, I need this job to support my living so I could focus build meanings and dreams of my life: dibya.org, a mentorship platform that help interested individuals to be skilled with software development skills to build their carrier.</p>

<p>But I am open to invest my life energy on your dreams if your business: vision/idea is awesome too.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a id="org408306d"></a></p>

<h3 id="about-dibya">about | dibya</h3>

<p><strong>Why:</strong> I have a dream: 5-10yrs from now, I would be able to create a platform: dibya: <a href="https://dibya.org">https://dibya.org</a> which would create a 10M+ skilled computer programmers on at least 5 developing countries like Nepal so nobody should limit their biggest life goal to green cards or go abroad, earn somewhat and buy a piece of land on Kathmandu in search of prosperity. My biggest worries is it applies mostly to youths(5.4M+) of my nation.</p>

<p>Just for that, I believe opportunities, wealth could be created in abundance if we could empower ourself with certain skill and act the right way, regardless of our geography or time-zones. I have few friends who are live by that example and I dream to see 100 thousands. My experience tells that our current education system should be transformed in a way such that a youngster could choose to develop his skills necessary to act on real piratical world and purse their own meanings. I remember how my dad felt on my convocation day when I said to him: &ldquo;I wasted 4yrs+ of my life on university struggling to learn things&rdquo;. Things that were delivered in a super boring ways that killed my interest on learning, things I would never use my entire life or things I could have just learned to google. 2160 hrs+ of life I spent after college is what has help me shape what I am today and it also applies to majorities of friends/people I know. I would never gain those 4yrs of my life back, but I could act in a way such that no one would ever have need to do the same.</p>

<p><strong>What/How</strong>: Via this platform, individuals could enroll to courses that engage them to hands-on courses, assignments/quizzes, code-reviews, feedback/support sessions, real-life project or practical lab sessions close to it. They even get benefits like: the scholarship: free access to most of advance courses, or re-fund (idea, yet to be concrete) if proven qualified. Think of it as, a school focused to groom individuals to equipped with all necessary skills on programming they need to do real world project(of their domain)</p>

<li>this guy is genuine, he speaks by his mind and heart</li>
<li>this guy will do something in life, he doesn&rsquo;t need job, all he needs is a support</li>
