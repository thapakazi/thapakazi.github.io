<h1 id="why-i-need-this-job-so-bad">Why I need this job so bad ?</h1>

<blockquote>
<p>Frankly speaking, I need this job to support my living so I could focus to build meanings and dreams of my life: dibya.org, a mentorship platform that help individuals to be skilled with software development skills to build their carrier.</p>

<p>But I am open to invest my life energy on your dreams if your business: vision/idea is awesome too.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a id="org64d4a70"></a></p>

<h3 id="about-dibya">About | DIBYA</h3>

<p><strong>Why:</strong> I have a dream: 5-10yrs from now, I would be able to create a platform: dibya: <a href="https://dibya.org">https://dibya.org</a> which would create a 10M+ skilled computer programmers on at least 5 developing countries like Nepal so nobody should limit their biggest life goal to green cards or go abroad, earn somewhat and buy a piece of land on Kathmandu in search of prosperity. My biggest worries is it applies mostly to youths(5.4M+) of my nation.</p>

<p>Just for that, I believe opportunities, wealth could be created in abundance if we could empower ourselves with certain skill and act the right way, regardless of our geography or time-zones. I have few friends who are living by that example and I dream to see that multiplied by 100 thousands. My experience tells that our current education system should be transformed in a way such that a youngster could choose to develop their skills necessary to act on real practical world and purse their own meanings. I remember how my dad felt on my convocation day when I said to him: <code>&quot;I wasted 4yrs+ of my life on university struggling to learn things&quot;</code>. Things that were delivered in a super boring ways that killed my interest on learning, things I would never use my entire life or things I could have just learned to google. 2160 hrs+ of life I spent after college is what has help me shape what I am today and it also applies to majorities of friends/people I know. I would never gain those 4yrs of my life back, but I could act in a way such that no one would ever have need to do the same.</p>

<p><strong>What/How</strong>: Via this platform: <a href="https://dibya.org">https://dibya.org</a>, individuals could enroll to courses that engage them to hands-on learning, assignments/quizzes, code-reviews, feedback/support sessions, real-life project or practical lab sessions close to it. Most of it is all guided by industry experts who are working on some real-world problems everyday. On top of it, learners could even get benefits like: the scholarship: free access to most of advance courses, interactions, or re-fund (idea, yet to be concrete) if proven qualified. Think of it as, a school focused to groom individuals to equipped with all necessary skills on programming they need to do real world project(of their domain).

<p><code>Edit:</code> If you like our idea: <strong>dibya.org</strong> your support (even the words of encouragements) would be highly appreciated. We just started 3 months+ ago on this idea, super early on that sense. If you have any thing to add/suggest or want to help on your own ways, write to us: knock.knock@dibya.org or on details below.</p>

<p>In my ~2000 days of my carrier, I have learned 100s of useful stuffs of hows (how to build things, how to run things, how to fix the broken, how to rescue things, how to how to communicate, how to how to do X and how to do Y)</p>

<p>But only recently, I woke up to see best possible use of all those hows, i.e, what I could do and most importantly why I want to do it.</p>
